Hashing in short: Normally passwords are stored in the database in a cryptographically secure manner, called a hash. This hash cannot be reversed to the password. Unless bruteforced, the stronger the password, the longer it will take, potentially up to tens/hundreds of thousands years (hashing algorithm and salting also can affect the difficulty in bruteforcing).
