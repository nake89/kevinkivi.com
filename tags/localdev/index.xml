When you can edit something on your local development machine and see the changes immediately (hot-reload), it makes the feedback loop smaller and makes development that much faster. Different toolkits have different ways of trying to solve local dev. Serverless Offline is a plugin for the Serverless Framework simulates AWS Lambda and other serverless providers to give a working offline version of that serverless app you are trying to create. So instead of calling e.g. &lt;code>https://12312321.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev&lt;/code> you would call &lt;code>http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code>. There is LocalStack which will emulate the whole AWS ecosystem. And most front-end frameworks have some sort of hot-reload enabled toolkit.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
