&lt;p>I have a Windows 98 SE virtual machine that I like to tinker with. I have Apache and PHP 5.1.X running on it. I have ansi.sys enabled MS-DOS terminal&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, so I can have colors and create cool CLI apps&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. I have VIM 7.3 installed in it.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Surprisingly enough vim-plug and vim-airline work.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> This means we can have a very modern development expierience on Vim. Vim 7.3 has omni-completion (a type of intellisense) and JS syntax highlighting. For editing text files or keeping notes I also have Notepad++. &lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> I also have webone installed. So I can connect to https sites. webone is a proxy that runs in a docker container that terminates the TLS connection. &lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>
As a fun exercise for myself I wanted to create a modern web app that would work on an old browser. I first picked IE5. Because it is the first browser to support XmlHttpRequest, which means it could be used to run a &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; web app. I then upgraded my IE5 to IE5.5. Now I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of compromising and running IE6. I have created a bundler and a JSX transpiler and a watcher. I have created a react-like web application, that supports routing and state. It supports JSX. Immediately if it detects a file change it compiles and bundles the files. And I just need to hit refresh on the browser and I can view my changes. Currently I don&amp;rsquo;t know if all of this works on my Windows 98 yet. It should though. I don&amp;rsquo;t like develeping on my Win98 because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have git. So I can keep my files in sync nice. That is why I&amp;rsquo;m creating a git &amp;ldquo;client&amp;rdquo; for Windows 98. It wont work completely standalone. It actually needs a server. Because it is a thin-client.
Internet Explorer &amp;lt;=6 had interesting quirks.[^doublemargin]&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WPAIO.one - What Page Am I On?</title><link>https://kevinkivi.com/posts/wpaio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:06:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkivi.com/posts/wpaio/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wanted to see if I could create and publish an app (website) in one day. This app had to have some practical value. An app to keep track of the current book I am reading (Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Oath of Office). I do use a bookmark, but it is very thin and I wanted an app where I can enter the page I&amp;rsquo;m currently on. So I created &lt;a href="https://wpaio.one">https://wpaio.one&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Local development is a joke (sometimes)</title><link>https://kevinkivi.com/posts/localdev/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:50:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkivi.com/posts/localdev/</guid><description>&lt;p>Local development has many benefits. When you can edit something on your local development machine and see the changes immediately (hot-reload), it makes the feedback loop smaller and makes development that much faster. Different toolkits have different ways of trying to solve local dev. Serverless Offline is a plugin for the Serverless Framework simulates AWS Lambda and other serverless providers to give a working offline version of that serverless app you are trying to create. So instead of calling e.g. &lt;code>https://12312321.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev&lt;/code> you would call &lt;code>http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code>. There is LocalStack which will emulate the whole AWS ecosystem. And most front-end frameworks have some sort of hot-reload enabled toolkit.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
