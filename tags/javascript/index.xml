It prints out one word at a time to the middle of the screen. It prints them out at 300WPM by default (raising the average reading speed of 200WPM). It is very effective for short bursts at least.

E.g.To make new food in Cronometer such as date paste, export &amp;ldquo;Dates&amp;rdquo; JSON from Cronometer. Then import the file. If the date paste is 15% water and 85% dates, then make the multiplier 0.85 and name it as you want. View at JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/nake89/2k78jxpt/</description></item></channel></rss>
