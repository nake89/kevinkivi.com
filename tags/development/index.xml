This app had to have some practical value. An app to keep track of the current book I am reading (Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Oath of Office). I do use a bookmark, but it is very thin and I wanted an app where I can enter the page I&amp;rsquo;m currently on. So I created &lt;a href="https://wpaio.one">https://wpaio.one&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Local development is a joke (sometimes)</title><link>https://kevinkivi.com/posts/localdev/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 15:50:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkivi.com/posts/localdev/</guid><description>&lt;p>Local development has many benefits. When you can edit something on your local development machine and see the changes immediately (hot-reload), it makes the feedback loop smaller and makes development that much faster. Different toolkits have different ways of trying to solve local dev. Serverless Offline is a plugin for the Serverless Framework simulates AWS Lambda and other serverless providers to give a working offline version of that serverless app you are trying to create. So instead of calling e.g. &lt;code>https://12312321.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev&lt;/code> you would call &lt;code>http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code>. There is LocalStack which will emulate the whole AWS ecosystem. And most front-end frameworks have some sort of hot-reload enabled toolkit.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
