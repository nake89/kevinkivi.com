It supports all of Namecheap&amp;rsquo;s API methods. I released the code on GitHub. Example of usage:

I know I am. Here is my node.js commandline application as a solution for that problem. This software requires node.js to run, which you can download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Installation npm i fore-cli -g
Usage fore domain.tld

This can be quite easily achieved. The arguments are contained in process.argv. arg.js
console.log(process.argv[0]); console.log(process.argv[1]); console.log(process.argv[2]); console.log(process.argv[3]); console.log(process.argv[4]); Testing the code:

It uses the joker.com API. I wrote it in node.js. It is still in development and I will add more functionality to this application. Here is the npm page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/joker-auto Github: https://github.com/nake89/joker-nodejs
Joker Automation This is a node.js script for automating Joker.com services. Still in early development. Currently only logs you in and unlocks a domain and gives you the auth-id (transfer key) of a domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
