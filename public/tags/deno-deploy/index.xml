      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally asked chatGPT to write this article. Just to test chatGPT out.
I forgot to mention that I wrote it with chatGPT and it was absolutely an
embarrasing piece of writing. It looked like a machine wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of article is still very interesting. Now maybe more than ever.
Because Deno 2.0 has been released. JSR exists. After about two years (?)
of using Deno what can I say about it that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been said. Nothing.
But I want to give my input.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
