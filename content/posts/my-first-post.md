I finally moved away from Wordpress. I wanted to write blogposts in markdown and store the posts in git. This way I can just edit my files in vim. Commit to git. I can host the files at Github Pages (or any other static file hoster). I used blog2md to convert the Wordpress posts to md. https://github.com/palaniraja/blog2md

 This tool wasn't perfect by any means. I had to re-edit all blog posts with codeblocks and fix some formatting issues. But it only took about 20 minutes or so.
