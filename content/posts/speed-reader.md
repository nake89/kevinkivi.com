I have been using this great speed reading webapp called Spreeder. It prints out one word at a time to the middle of the screen. It prints them out at 300WPM by default (raising the average reading speed of 200WPM). It is very effective for short bursts at least. Link to Spreeder: https://www.spreeder.com/app.php?intro=1

I was wondering if I could dev this in one day (more or less). Here is the result: https://nake89.github.io/speed-reader/

It is lacking some polish but it does work.
