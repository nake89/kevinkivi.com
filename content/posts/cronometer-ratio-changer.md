I created a script (with the help of my wife) which can change the ratio of foods. E.g.To make new food in Cronometer such as date paste, export "Dates" JSON from Cronometer. Then import the file. If the date paste is 15% water and 85% dates, then make the multiplier 0.85 and name it as you want. Click "Result" below to use the script.
