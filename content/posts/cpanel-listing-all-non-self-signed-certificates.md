I made a bash script listing all non-self-signed certificates (for certain user by username or domain or for all users) in cPanel.

```
Usage: lrcert [OPTION] [INPUT]
Example: lrcert [cPanel username]

Options:
  -d [domain]      Displays all certificates of the owner of the domain.
  -a, --all        Lists all certificates of all cPanel users
  -v, --version    Displays version.
  -h, --help       This help page.
```
