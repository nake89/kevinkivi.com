I am a 31 year old software developer, husband and father from Vantaa, Finland. I speak fluent Finnish and English. My current passion is serverless services like (AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Cloudflare Workers, etc) but I am interested in all new tech (and super old). In my free time I work on open source software.

I am currently studying for the AWS Certified Developer exam.
