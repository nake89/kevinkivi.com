I am a 35 year old software developer, husband and father of two from Vantaa, Finland. I speak fluent Finnish and English. I currently work in Telia (the largest TeleCom of the Nordics) in the Broadband Data Mediation team as a senior software engineer. My current passion is Deno. In my free time I work on open source software.
