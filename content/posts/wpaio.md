I wanted to see if I could create and publish an app (website) in one day. This app had to have some practical value. An app to keep track of the current book I am reading (Tom Clancy's Oath of Office). I do use a bookmark, but it is very thin and I wanted an app where I can enter the page I'm currently on. So I created https://wpaio.one
