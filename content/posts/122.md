`public`, `private` and `protected` are properties of variables and functions in classes. They define the scope in which they can be in used. `public`Â is visible outside its class and can be called outside of the class. `private` is only visible inside its class and can only be called inside the class. `protected` is the same as private except for the fact that it is also visible and can be called in classes that extend its own class.
