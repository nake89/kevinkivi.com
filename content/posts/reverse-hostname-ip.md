Are you tired of typing `host domain.tld` and then typing `host 123.123.123.123` just to be able to get the reverse of the ip of the hostname you're interested in. I know I am. Here is my node.js commandline application as a solution for that problem. This software requires node.js to run, which you can download here: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**Installation** `npm i fore-cli -g`

**Usage** `fore domain.tld`

**Example**
```
# fore kevinkivi.com
hel1-77-86-179-68.ext.nebulacloud.fi

```
