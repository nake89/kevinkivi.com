I know I havent posted in a long time. I totally forgot about blogger. Anyway just wanted to add something and now I have a reason. I made a cool userscript. Userscripts are things to change something about a page, to make it more usable or pretty or something. It works with firefox if you have greasemonkey installed. Anyway here is the script: [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4039](https://web.archive.org/web/20070119151139/http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4039) It puts a simple favicon in a forum I post alot. The favicon: ![image](favicon.gif) Its short for ElxDraco. Well duh. :D
