I am a 35 year old software developer, husband and father of three from Helsinki, Finland. I speak fluent Finnish and English. I currently work in Telia (the largest TeleCom of the Nordics) in the Broadband Data Mediation team as a senior software engineer. My current passion is Retro Computing. I am currently trying to build a react like SPA that runs on IE5/6. In my free time I work on open source software.
